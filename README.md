# mdiff

## A command line tool to visually diff 3D meshes.

# example

``` shell

mdiff mesh1.obj mesh2.obj

```

# build

## Mac OSX


### If you already have git and node installed just run this from the command line
 ```
git clone https://TimothyStiles@bitbucket.org/TimothyStiles/mdiff.git && cd mdiff && npm run build 

```

To install mdiff you will need to have node installed.

I typically would suggest that you install it through the Mac OSX package manager
